## Coredump Preservation

To facilitate debugging in the event of a crash, Nebula Graph automatically preserves coredumps generated by metad, graphd and storaged when the coredump preservation feature is enabled. The coredumps are 
storged on a seperate volume generated by Nebula operator during cluster installation. You are able to specify the size of the generated volume and the amount of time the coredump should be kept. 

### Prerequisites
* Nebula operator is installed
* Nebula operator version >= 1.8.2

### Using the coredump preservation feature
The coredump preservation feature can be used by either installing the Nebula cluster using the provided helm chart in this repo or by adding the required values directly in your 
nebulacluster.yaml configuration. The steps for using each method are listed below

#### Using the Coredump preservation feature with the provided Nebula Cluster helm chart
The coredump preservation feature is enabled by default when installing with the provided Nebula cluster helm chart. The default values for the size of the generated volume and the amount of
time the coredump is kept is 5Gi and 72h respectively.
