### Log rotation

We use the sidecar container to clean NebulaGraph logs and run logs archiving tasks every hour.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.nebula-graph.io/v1alpha1
kind: NebulaCluster
metadata:
  name: nebula
spec:
  graphd:
    config:
      # Whether logging files' name contain timestamp.
      "timestamp_in_logfile_name": "false"
  metad:
    config:
      "timestamp_in_logfile_name": "false"
  storaged:
    config:
      "timestamp_in_logfile_name": "false"
  logRotate:
    # Log files are rotated count times before being removed  
    rotate: 5
    # Log files are rotated only if they grow bigger than size bytes
    size: "100M"
```

### Write log to stdout

If you do not need to mount additional log disks in order to save costs on the cloud,
and collect them through services such as fluent-bit and send them to the log center, you can refer to the configuration below.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.nebula-graph.io/v1alpha1
kind: NebulaCluster
metadata:
  name: nebula
spec:
  graphd:
    config:
      # Whether to redirect stdout and stderr to separate output files
      redirect_stdout: "false"
      # The numbers of severity level INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and FATAL are 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
      stderrthreshold: "0"
    env:
    - name: GLOG_logtostderr # Logs are written to standard error instead of to files
      value: "1"
